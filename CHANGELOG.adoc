[[IRCPlugin-Version-2.33]]
[[IRCPlugin-Version-2.32]]
== Version 2.32 and 2.33 (2020-04-23)

https://github.com/jenkinsci/ircbot-plugin/compare/ircbot-2.31...jenkinsci:ircbot-2.32

* Fixed use of default targets from global config
* Ported documentation from old Wiki to in-codebase README

[[IRCPlugin-Version-2.31]]
== Version 2.31 (2019-08-09)

https://github.com/jenkinsci/ircbot-plugin/compare/ircbot-2.30...jenkinsci:ircbot-2.31

* Added a Jenkinsfile to CI-test the plugin itself:
https://github.com/jenkinsci/ircbot-plugin/pull/19
* Non-functional whitespace, javadoc and style fixes in the codebase for
better maintainability:
https://github.com/jenkinsci/ircbot-plugin/pull/20
* Added pipeline support to match capabilities of
instant-messaging-plugin release 1.36 (not fully published) and 1.37:
https://github.com/jenkinsci/ircbot-plugin/pull/21 and then 1.38:
https://github.com/jenkinsci/ircbot-plugin/pull/23
** So now there is an `ircNotify()` step with numerous supported
options (or default activity if none are passed) for `Jenkinsfile`
scripts!
* Added a `customMessage` option to instantly post the specified
message to specified IM target(s) as the payload of a step (not tied
into notification strategies for build start/completion): part of
https://github.com/jenkinsci/ircbot-plugin/pull/21
* Note that currently there is special syntax for build-start
notifications from a pipeline step (e.g. `ircNotify notifyOnStart:true`)
which is intended as a *temporary* solution to the problem of not having
support for an IM-specific `options{...}` setting in pipelines yet, and
so reporting "NOT BUILT" (via completion-notification mode) if there was
no verdict yet
