[[IRCPlugin-Version-2.40]]
== Version 2.40 (2021-09-28)

https://github.com/jenkinsci/ircbot-plugin/compare/ircbot-2.39...jenkinsci:ircbot-2.40

* Some more recipe updates, dependency versions and cosmetic fixes

[[IRCPlugin-Version-2.39]]
== Version 2.39 (2021-09-08)

https://github.com/jenkinsci/ircbot-plugin/compare/ircbot-2.38...jenkinsci:ircbot-2.39

* Some more recipe updates, dependency versions and cosmetic fixes

[[IRCPlugin-Version-2.38]]
== Version 2.38 (2021-09-08)

https://github.com/jenkinsci/ircbot-plugin/compare/ircbot-2.37...jenkinsci:ircbot-2.38

* Updated build recipes to include dependabot and to keep the `pom.xml`
  style common with some other plugins to simplify cross-pollination
* Bumped several dependency versions
* Rectified parts of codebase to match the new quality constraints

[[IRCPlugin-Version-2.37]]
== Version 2.37 (2021-08-27)

https://github.com/jenkinsci/ircbot-plugin/compare/ircbot-2.36...jenkinsci:ircbot-2.37

* Remove usages of Guava

[[IRCPlugin-Version-2.36]]
== Version 2.36 (2020-12-12)

https://github.com/jenkinsci/ircbot-plugin/compare/ircbot-2.35...jenkinsci:ircbot-2.36

* Revised solution for job configuration UI broken after Jenkins core
  2.264 (dropped HTML tables)
* Modernized saving and processing of job and global configurations
** https://jenkins.io/security/advisory/2019-04-03/#SECURITY-829 should
   now be fixed
** Plain-text passwords were optionally "scrambled" for some years now,
   but in this release the changes done by @timja make use of standard
   `secretPassword` fields. To update the on-disk representation of
   your IRC user and channel passwords, it should suffice to open and
   save your Jenkins global configuration after upgrading the plugin.
** Note that some field names would be updated in the configuration file 
   `$JENKINS_HOME/hudson.plugins.ircbot.IrcPublisher.xml` after this
   upgrade.
* Changed default IRC nickname for new deployments of the bot to `jenkins`
  (from `jenkins-bot`) be in limits set by RFC 2812 (9 chars), and added
  notes to the nickname editing fields in the UI (global config of the
  server as a client to IRC; individual users' configs to link their IRC
  accounts to Jenkins account)

[[IRCPlugin-Version-2.35]]
[[IRCPlugin-Version-2.34]]
== Version 2.34 and 2.35 (2020-12-05)

https://github.com/jenkinsci/ircbot-plugin/compare/ircbot-2.33...jenkinsci:ircbot-2.35

* First-shot solution for job configuration UI broken after Jenkins core 2.264 (dropped HTML tables)
* Refresh plugin recipe
* Further docs migration into Git

[[IRCPlugin-Version-2.33]]
[[IRCPlugin-Version-2.32]]
== Version 2.32 and 2.33 (2020-04-23)

https://github.com/jenkinsci/ircbot-plugin/compare/ircbot-2.31...jenkinsci:ircbot-2.33

* Fixed use of default targets from global config
* Ported documentation from old Wiki to in-codebase README

[[IRCPlugin-Version-2.31]]
== Version 2.31 (2019-08-09)

https://github.com/jenkinsci/ircbot-plugin/compare/ircbot-2.30...jenkinsci:ircbot-2.31

* Added a Jenkinsfile to CI-test the plugin itself:
https://github.com/jenkinsci/ircbot-plugin/pull/19
* Non-functional whitespace, javadoc and style fixes in the codebase for
better maintainability:
https://github.com/jenkinsci/ircbot-plugin/pull/20
* Added pipeline support to match capabilities of
instant-messaging-plugin release 1.36 (not fully published) and 1.37:
https://github.com/jenkinsci/ircbot-plugin/pull/21 and then 1.38:
https://github.com/jenkinsci/ircbot-plugin/pull/23
** So now there is an `ircNotify()` step with numerous supported
options (or default activity if none are passed) for `Jenkinsfile`
scripts!
* Added a `customMessage` option to instantly post the specified
message to specified IM target(s) as the payload of a step (not tied
into notification strategies for build start/completion): part of
https://github.com/jenkinsci/ircbot-plugin/pull/21
* Note that currently there is special syntax for build-start
notifications from a pipeline step (e.g. `ircNotify notifyOnStart:true`)
which is intended as a *temporary* solution to the problem of not having
support for an IM-specific `options{...}` setting in pipelines yet, and
so reporting "NOT BUILT" (via completion-notification mode) if there was
no verdict yet

Notification" configuration as illustrated below: +
  +
[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper]#image:docs/images/hudson-irc-project.PNG[image]# +

For the project configuration, leave the Channels blank to default to
the channels defined in the controller IRC configration.
